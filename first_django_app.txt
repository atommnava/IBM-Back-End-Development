1. Install these must-have packages and setup the environment.

pip install --upgrade distro-info
pip3 install --upgrade pip==23.2.1
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv djangoenv
source djangoenv/bin/activate

2. Go to terminal and run:
pip install Django

3. Once the installation is finished, you can create your first Django project by running:
django-admin startproject firstproject
A folder called firstproject will be created which is a container wrapping up settings and configurations for a Django project.

If your current working directory is not /home/project/firstproject, cd to the project folder
cd firstproject
and create a Django app called firstapp within the project

python3 manage.py startapp firstapp

Django created a project scaffold for you containing your first firstapp app.

manage.py is a command-line interface used to interact with the Django project to perform tasks such as starting the server,
migrating models, and so on.
firstproject/settings.py contains the settings and configurations information.
firstproject/urls.py contains the URL and route definitions of your Django apps within the project.

4. Before starting the app, you will to perform migrations to create necessary database tables:

python3 manage.py makemigrations

and run migration
python3 manage.py migrate

5. Then start a development server hosting apps in the firstproject:
python3 manage.py runserver

Click on the Skills Network button on the left, it will open the “Skills Network Toolbox”. 
Then click the Other then Launch Application.
From there you should be able to enter the port 8000 and launch.
