2.1 We want to retrieve the film names and director and writer names. The query now would be:

SELECT Title, Director, Writer FROM FilmLocations;

    But we also want to restrict the output resultset to retrieve only the film records released in 2001 and onwards (release years after 2001, including 2001).

SELECT Title, ReleaseYear, Locations FROM FilmLocations WHERE ReleaseYear >= 2001;
